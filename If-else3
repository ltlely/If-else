/* Create a program that will help someone get an estimate of how much they might owe in federal
income taxes for the year. Allow the user to enter his or her income for the entire year. Based
on their income the program should determine their tax rate as well as an estimate for how much
they might owe. The tax rate and the amount of taxes they owe should be printed to the screen.
Use the following tax brackets for the program:
 10% on taxable income from $0 to $10,000
 20% on taxable income over $10,000 to $50,000
 30% on taxable income over $50,000 to $100,000
 40% on taxable income over $100,000  
1. create how much they owe in federal income taxes for a year
2. allow user enter the income for entire year
3. based on income, determine tax rate + estimate how much they owe*/

         System.out.println ("Please enter your income for the year, your income will determine your tax rate and how much you owe.");
         Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in);
         int income = scan.nextInt();
         
         if (income >= 0 || income <= 10000) {
             
             System.out.println ("Your tax rate is 10%");
             System.out.println ("You owe " + income*.10);
             
         }
