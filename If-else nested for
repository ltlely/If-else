/* Write an application that prompts a user for the number of years that user has until 
retirement and the amount of money the user can save annually.  If the user enters a 0 or 
negative number for either value, re-prompt the user until valid entries are made. Assume 
that the user earns 5% interest on the balance every year. Display the amount of money the 
user will have at retirement.
1. Ask user number of years until retirement + amount of money can save annually
2. save
3. If user input 0/negative, repromt user until valid entries
4. User earns 5% interest on balance EVERY year
5. Display amount of money user have at retirement
