/* Create a program that allows a student to calculate how much tuition they owe for one 
semester at a community college. The student will be asked for the number of credits they are 
taking this semester. The student will then be asked if they are an in-state student. In-state 
students are charged $100.00 dollars per credit, but out-of-state students will be charged $200.00 per 
credit. The program should end by displaying the number of credits the student is taking this semester, 
whether they are an in-state student or an out-of-state student, the cost per credit, and the tuition the 
student owes for this semester. */
