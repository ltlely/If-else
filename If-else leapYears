      /* A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the earth takes 
      longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap 
      year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The 
      requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

      1) The year must be divisible by 4
      2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400
      Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
      Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year. */

/*  In general terms the algorithm for calculating a leap year is as follows...

A year will be a leap year if it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. If a year is divisible by 4 and by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is 
also divisible by 400.

Thus years such as 1996, 1992, 1988 and so on are leap years because they are divisible by 4 but not by 100. For century years, the 400 
rule is important. Thus, century years 1900, 1800 and 1700 while all still divisible by 4 are also exactly divisible by 100. As they are not further 
divisible by 400, they are not leap years  */
